\section{Contributions I}
	\textbf{Hypothesis}: learning shape requires abstracting away appearance -> hence disentangling
	% \textbf{Hypothesis \emph{ii)}}: learning disentanglement from data is fundamentally constrained. disentangling without supervision impossible from pure data and without explicit model
	% need to interact with the world, need to change, need to model physical reality -> image transformations, analyis-by-synthesis
	\begin{itemize}
		\item validate and evaluate method developed by Lorenz \etal\ 2018 for disentangling
		\item overview over state-of-the-art disentangling, analysis of future directions
		\item explain method in context to these
		\item evaluate unsupervised shape learning:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item human faces, bodies (CelebA, Human3.6M)
				\item animal faces, bodies (cats, dogs, birds)
				\item composite objects (dancing pair)
			\end{itemize}
		\item make own video dataset
			\begin{itemize}
				\item for disentangling human pose and appearance (heidelbergpose)
				\item for articulated animal video (dogs)
				\item for composite object (pair dancing salsa)
			\end{itemize}
		\item ablation study (reconstruction, equivariance loss, transformations)
		\item study: effect of image transformations
		\item qualitative comparison to non-disentangling composite shape learning (Zhang)
		\item evaluating disentanglement
			\begin{itemize}
				\item reID
				\item pose estimation
			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	result: soa in shape learning, (first) unsupervised disentangling of articulated shape and appearance

\section{Contributions II}
	\textbf{Hypothesis}: learning object shape efficiently requires a composite explanation in terms of equivariant parts.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item develop and analyze method for learning object shape
		\item performance analysis of:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item hierarchy of parts
				\item number of keypoints
				\item local loss weighting
				\item feature aggregation (1/1+..)
				\item part shapes (qualitatively Penn Action)
			\end{itemize}
		\item make dataset (heidelbergpose)
		\item compare against holistic representation (Jakab) on BBCPose quantitatively
		\item generative results on human poses, faces (KTH, CelebA, Human)
		\item add part-wise adversarial task (BBCPose, DeepFashion)
		\item part-wise swapping, moving parts independently (DF, and own data)
	\end{itemize}
	result: state-of-the-art in unsupervised shape learning, learning part regions unsupervised, manipulating generation part-wise possible
