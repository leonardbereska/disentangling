\section{Conclusion}
We have presented an unsupervised approach to learning the compositional part structure of objects by disentangling shape from appearance. We incorporate invariance and equivariance constraints in a generative framework. The model discovers consistent parts without requiring prior assumptions. Experiments show our approach significantly improves upon previous unsupervised methods.
