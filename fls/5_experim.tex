\section{Shape Learning}
	\subsection{Landmark Discovery}
		\subsubsection{Human Faces}
		\subsubsection{Human Bodies}
		Human, Olympic, Penn
		\subsubsection{Animal Faces/Bodies}
		Dogs, Cats, Birds
		\subsubsection{Composite Objects/Scenes}
		What is an object? What is a scene?
		compositional nature of reality
		Bird on twig object? Bird can also fly, but neural networks learn by correlation in data (-> ref to these ''failure modes''
		Dancing pair as object.
		\subsubsection{Object/Background Separation}
			Complexly cluttered background is actually favorable for the method. Correlations of object with background will belong to object.
	\subsection{Transformations}
	\subsubsection{Parity}
	birds parity
	salsa parity
	\subsubsection{Rotation, Scaling, Translation}
		on Cats -> black cats different set of KP than rest -> connect these samples via transformation to reach intra-class consistency
	\subsubsection{Mimicking Appearance}
	Color, Contrast, Hue
	\subsection{Natural Changes}
	Video data: Penn, Own
\section{Disentangling Generative Factors}
	t-SNE of Shape Representation
	\subsection{Disentangling Pose and Appearance}
	\subsubsection{ReID}
	t-SNE of IDs
	Own, Other (stronger statement)
	\subsubsection{Pose}
	PCK Curve
	\subsection{Factorizing into Parts}
		Own Dataset: Move KP
		DeepFashion: exchange parts
\section{Follow-Up}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item make generative:(KP distribution estimation, variational features).
		\item make video generation possible (RNN on KP vector).
		\item better transformations -> appearance locally (around parts changed), appearance changed perceptually -> style transfer
	\end{itemize}
